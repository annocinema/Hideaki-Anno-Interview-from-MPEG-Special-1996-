1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
What if everyone in the world did
exactly as I said for one moment.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,590
Anno Hideaki

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,690
The whole world, 4 billion people, doing exactly
as I say. But, that's not what I want at all.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,230
I'm just trying to create the best work I can.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,160
Direction of Neon Genesis Evangelion

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,270
When you're thinking of a path to take a story,

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,110
you start off with a full 360ยบ parameter.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:37,220
To take the first step, you, of course, have to decide
to go somewhere within that 360ยบ parameter.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:44,320
Let's say you decide north.
You stake a post there first.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,900
Once that's done, you have another
360ยบ directional decision to make.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,070
That's how I work.

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,300
The deciding factors for those 360ยบ
are the current situation, staff...

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,980
Money and time. It's all based on
the work environment at the time.

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,050
It's also a personal decision.

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,380
"Set and setting" as they say.

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,950
Think of highlighting a spreadsheet.

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:23,500
You decide your route, and with every
cell, you can see a little more of a path.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,830
When you look back, it dawns on you,
"So this is how it comes together."

19
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,670
Rei and Asuka

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,210
There is a character for all kinds of fans.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,780
A relationship triangle. It makes a triangle.

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:46,050
1 boy and 2 girls, one upbeat
and one quiet. It all splits.

23
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,120
For fans of upbeat girls, there is Asuka.
For fans of quiet girls, there is Rei.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:57,400
There is also the hair lengths. Short hair
fans have Rei. Long hair fans have Asuka.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,170
With that, we can get all of the fans.

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,240
That was the basic plan.

27
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,470
All that was left was the curvy girls fans.

28
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,770
Production Goals

29
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,010
Pride.

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,780
You want a sense of pride from your anime.

31
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,780
This is....

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,320
In the animation world, I would
go so far as to say I'm famous.

33
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,930
But, if I was to walk into
a bar and sit at the counter,

34
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,500
it's not a job I could easily use to strike up a
conversation with the girl sitting next to me.

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,360
It's embarrassing.

36
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,640
It's so embarrassing, it's not a topic
I want to bring up, so I gloss over it.

37
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:47,410
I guess that means I don't have much
pride in the anime I've completed.

38
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,280
It's embarrassing. It's under par work.

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:01,830
A misconception among anime fans is they believe
 animation is popular media. It's not like that.

40
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,960
I'm still underground level.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,770
Everyone that doesn't remain a major
player ends up branded as inferior.

42
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,970
Unless you're a big hitter
you're a nothing. It's shameful.

43
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,440
That's one thing I'd like to
get rid of in the community.

44
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,580
If I meet someone who has seen Evangelion,

45
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,390
I want to be able to say that I was the
director of it without feeling embarrassed.

46
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,420
That's pride.

47
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,960
If I'm talking to a stranger, I want to tell them
about my anime. Even though I can't explain it well,

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,470
when they finally see it, they won't
question it like, "What even is this?"

49
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:48,470
At the very least, I want them
to be glad they continued.

50
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:54,010
Our 30-year old target demographic
was the basis of Evangelion.

51
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,920
I want to increase people's pride. I don't
think anime fans have enough pride.

52
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,220
I know I don't have enough pride in my work.

53
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,460
If I can improve that sense of pride,

54
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,160
Ah, wait. I want to try making a film
that invokes that sense of pride.

55
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:20,010
I see it as a step towards normalcy.

56
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,140
The Future of Anime

57
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,840
Bleak.

58
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,910
Bleak?

59
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,310
Bleak.

60
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,640
No hope?
Bleak.

61
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,210
No hope?

62
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,310
No light at the end of the tunnel?

63
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,980
It would be great if there
were light. Is there light?

64
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,520
I can't see it.

65
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,450
Could Eva be the light?

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,160
Eva has the power to step outside the box.

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,330
I was very conscious of that.
I wanted to get out of the box.

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,000
Even though I wanted to go out of the box, the
results show a slow retreat to seclusion within.

69
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,140
This isn't just a problem with anime. It's
something affecting all Japanese media.

70
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:10,290
It feels like the walls around Japan are quickly
blocking us in, and soon we'll have no escape.

71
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,190
It's a question of how far the courage
to take that leap out will take us.
